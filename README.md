# Mini_Secchi_SOCON

This GitHub repository contains a Juypter notebook showing how to extract Secchi depth and Forel Ule colour data from the MONOCLE data server, collected using the Mini-Secchi disk as part of the SOCON project. The code extracts data, does a basic quality control of it, and produces some plots of the geographical and statistical distribution of the data. 

Code was developed by Bob Brewin and utalises the MONDA package (see https://github.com/monocle-h2020/MONDA)

The notebook can be run directly through a website in binder, by clicking the symbol below
