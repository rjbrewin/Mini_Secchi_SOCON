# Mini_Secchi_SOCON

This GitHub repository show an example of how to extract Secchi depth and Forel Ule colour data from the MONOCLE data server, collected using the Mini-Secchi disk as part of the SOCON project. The code extracts data, does a basic quality control of it, and produces some maps of the data distribution and statistical distribution of the data. 

Code was developed by Bob Brewin.
